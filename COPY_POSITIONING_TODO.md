# Copy & Positioning Issues - Review After Funnel Test

**Created:** 2025-11-20
**Status:** On hold until funnel is tested properly

## The Problem

Current "class" framing implies video content, but $47 product is a digital book.
- 12% refund rate (industry standard: 3-5%)
- May increase as more 30-day windows close

## Planned Funnel Structure

- $47 = Digital book (tripwire)
- $77 = Videos only
- $97 = Videos + kit
- $59 = Kit only

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Soft clarify (recommended short-term)
Add near checkout: "Instant access to your complete digital book. Video walkthroughs coming January 2025."

### Option 2: Order bump style
Be explicit: "Your $47 gets the complete digital book. Want video walkthroughs? Add them for $30 more"

### Option 3: Rebrand
Change to "Kintsugi Guide" but you own kintsugiclass.com - domain friction

### Option 4: Full rewrite
Change all "class/modules/training" to "guide/book" - kills the vibe

## Worst Offenders in Copy (if we decide to fix)

1. Hero headline: "She's Teaching This 500-Year Old Technique Online For The First Time (Learn In 3 Hours)"
2. Pricing: "5 Core Modules - 3 hours ($297)" / "3 Bonus Trainings ($111)"
3. Guarantee: "Try the entire class"

## Long-term Consideration

The "class" domain/brand will always create friction for a book-first funnel. May need different domain if this model works at scale.

## Action Items

- [ ] Monitor refund rate over next 2 weeks
- [ ] If stays 12%+, implement soft clarify (Option 1)
- [ ] Once videos exist, revisit entire funnel positioning
- [ ] Consider if $47 should include videos (kills upsell but fixes expectations)
