MODERN KINTSUGI AD COPY - JANUARY 2026
========================================

AD 1 - CREATION VS CONSUMPTION
------------------------------

When was the last time you *created* something?

Not a Reel. Not consumed. Not scrolled. Not bought something made by machines in factories.

When was the last time you made art with your hands that made someone say "Wait... YOU made this?"

When was the last time you felt completely present—not thinking about work, not checking your phone, just... creating?

You want a hobby that's actually meaningful. Something meditative. Something therapeutic.

Not another thing to consume. Something to CREATE.

Kintsugi (金継ぎ) is the 500-year-old Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics with gold.

It's peaceful. Meditative. Screen-free.

The philosophy behind it:
  → Wabi-sabi: beauty in imperfection
  → Mottainai: never letting anything go to waste
  → Mono no aware: appreciating impermanence

I spent months learning this. Then people started asking me to teach them. One woman wrote: "I have scars, and kintsugi reminds me that what's broken can become more beautiful."

So I created a 2-hour video course. Food-safe materials, under $30 to start, no experience needed.

For the first 50 students the price is $47.

AD 2 - MEMORY / SENTIMENTAL
---------------------------

A grandfather's only whiskey glass. A dad's coffee mug. A mother's favorite vase.

Some things aren't "just things". They are precious memories.

And when they break, throwing them away feels... wrong.

Especially now. With everyone glued to their phones. Social media, AI, this unending isolation.

...I think we could all use something a little more real. Not another thing to consume. Something to CREATE.

Kintsugi (金継ぎ) is the 500-year-old Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics with gold.

It's peaceful. Meditative. Screen-free.

The philosophy behind it:
  → Wabi-sabi: beauty in imperfection
  → Mottainai: never letting anything go to waste
  → Mono no aware: appreciating impermanence

I spent months learning this—studying traditional Japanese techniques and modern methods. Then people started asking me to teach them.

One woman wrote: "I need to learn this. I have scars, and kintsugi reminds me that what's broken can become more beautiful than before."

So I put everything into a 2-hour video course. Food-safe materials, under $30 to start, no experience needed.

You'll repair broken pottery with gold. Create heirlooms. Make gifts that carry meaning. Make something even more beautiful than before it was broken.

For the first 50 students the price is $47.
