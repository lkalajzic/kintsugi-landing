# Black Friday Fork Plan

**Date:** November 19, 2025
**Status:** Planned for implementation in ~3-5 days

## Strategy

Keep current "founding students" page running (33% CR, profitable). Create separate Black Friday fork to test seasonal messaging without risking current funnel.

## Implementation

### Separate Page Options
1. `/black-friday` route on same domain
2. New subdomain: `blackfriday.kintsugiclass.com`
3. Separate domain (if running different brand angle)

### Copy Changes
- Replace "First 50 students online • November 2025" → "Black Friday Special • November 2025"
- Replace "founding student pricing" → "Black Friday pricing"
- Update timer copy: "Black Friday enrollment closes in..."
- Update pricing section: "After Black Friday, class returns to $97"

### Technical Setup
- Duplicate current page
- Update all "founding" language to "Black Friday"
- Keep same $47 price point
- Same checkout flow (don't mess with what works)
- Separate ad campaigns pointing to BF page

## Post-Launch Strategy

### After hitting 50 founding students:
1. Archive "founding students" messaging
2. Switch to rotating 3-day sales model:
   - Black Friday (Nov 29-Dec 2)
   - Cyber Monday (Dec 2-5)
   - Holiday Special (Dec 15-18)
   - New Year Launch (Dec 30-Jan 2)
   - Winter Practice (Jan 10-13)
   - Etc.

### Pricing Model
- Always $47 during sales
- "Regular price $97" (establishes value anchor)
- Different promo name every 3 days
- Continuous urgency, always ethical (real promo cycles)

## Why This Works
- No fake scarcity (each promo actually ends)
- Different messaging for different audiences
- Can test what converts best
- Always a reason to buy NOW
- 100% ethical/legal

## Next Steps
- [ ] Build Black Friday fork in 3-5 days
- [ ] Set up separate ad campaigns
- [ ] Test conversion rate vs. founding students angle
- [ ] Document which messaging performs best
