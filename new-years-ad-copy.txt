Learn the ancient Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics with gold.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When was the last time you *created* something?

Not a Reel. Not consumed. Not scrolled. Not bought something made by machines in factories.

When was the last time you made art with your hands that made someone say "Wait... YOU made this?"

When was the last time you felt completely present—not thinking about work, not checking your phone, just... creating?

No expensive pair of skis or collection of products can fill the void. You need to create.

You want a hobby that's actually meaningful. Something meditative. Something therapeutic.

Not another thing to consume. Something to CREATE.

✦ Kintsugi (金継ぎ) is the 500-year-old Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics with gold.

It's peaceful. Meditative. Screen-free.

The philosophy behind it:
🥀 Wabi-sabi: beauty in imperfection
♻️ Mottainai: never letting anything go to waste
⌛ Mono no aware: appreciating impermanence

I'm Yuki. I spent years learning from Japanese masters who've practiced this art for generations.

Then people started asking me to teach them. One woman named Sarah wrote: "I have scars, and kintsugi reminds me that what's broken can become more beautiful than before."

That's when I knew I had to share this. So now I'm teaching it online for the first time.

What you'll learn:
✨ Repair broken pottery with gold (or affordable alternatives under $30)
✨ Create heirlooms from broken pieces
✨ Make gifts that actually carry meaning
✨ Transform something broken into something more beautiful

And maybe learn something about yourself too.

Right now it's 80% off for New Year's because I want as many people as possible to start the year with something meaningful.
